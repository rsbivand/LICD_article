Reproduction materials for "The application of Local Indicators for Categorical Data (LICD) to explore spatial dependence in archaeological spaces" by Francesco Carrer, Tomasz M. Kossowski, Justyna Wilk, Micha≈Ç B. Pietrzak and Roger Bivand

Script `LICD-Archaeo-HLC.R` runs the Torridge example, downloading data from given URLs, so requires internet access; it sources local_JC0.R. It generates `Torridge_*.jpeg` and `jc_out.csv`.

Script `LICD-Archaeo-Grid.R` runs the Barmose example, using data from the **archdata** package. It generates `Barmose_*.jpeg` and `barmose_jc_out.csv`.

Both scripts are run using `source(..., echo=TRUE)`, with output to `*_output.Rout` respectively. This also contains the output  of `sessionInfo()` for the output files included in this repository.

File `HLC_map.zip` is a compressed stand-alone interactive webmap produced in running `LICD-Archaeo-HLC.R`; to use, uncompress and open `index.html`. It was made using the development version of **mapview** (see https://github.com/r-spatial/mapview/issues/336) as noted on line 151 of the script.
